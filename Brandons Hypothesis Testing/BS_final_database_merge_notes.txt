 
FINAL DATA  - DATABASE CREATION 


Hypothesis:


1.)Hypothesis: There is a significant difference between income and customer satisfaction.
	Null: There is no significant difference between income and consumer satisfaction 


2.) Hypothesis: There is a significant difference between overall hospital rating and procedure charge
	Null: There is no significant difference between overall hospital rating and procedure charge

3.) Hypothesis: There is a significant different between population density and medical procedure cost.
	Null: There is no significant difference between population density and medical procedure cost. 

4.) Hypothesis: There is a significant cost difference knee and diabetes procedures across private government medical centers.
	Null:  There is not a significant cost difference knee and diabetes procedures across private government medical centers.

DATABASE CREATION STEPS:

A.) what data do we have : 
		* national drg -( diabetes/Joint ), charges , survey alpha
		* national drg -( diabetes/Joint ), charges , survey numeric
		* census data for NY 

B.)  what data do we need ? 
		* census data CA and MS 
B-2.)  How do we obtain this data ? 
		* using the [  https://uszipcode.readthedocs.io/index.html  ]  library
		* we need zip codes for entire state
		* open nation map , extract state,  then extract zip code column, then drop duplicates 

C.) what needs to be merged?
		* census and survey numeric for CA, MS, NY

		
D.) what is the best way to merge it ? ( look at the files /formats , think can only merge 2 at a time, think final format)

E.) what formatting or categories  are  needed after merge?  
	* we need to categorize :  income into 1,2,3 buckets, city type by rural , sub, and urban

Metropolitan statistical areas consist of the county or counties (or equivalent entities) associated with at least one urbanized
 area of at least 50,000 population, plus adjacent counties having a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as m

For example, New York City’s density value (almost 28,000 people per square mile) is notably higher than that of Los Angeles (about 8,300 people per square mile)

Urbanized Areas (UAs) of 50,000 or more people;

In 2000, the Census Bureau
expanded the classification
to include two types of urban
areas: urbanized areas and
urban clusters. Urbanized areas
are areas with 50,000 or more
people. Urban clusters are areas
with at least 2,500 but fewer than
50,000 people.7

In order for a block to qualify
as urban, it must have a density of 1,000 people per square
mile (ppsm). Using an automated
process, qualifying blocks are
aggregated to form a central core
area. Once the initial identification
process is concluded, a second
automated pass is initiated with a
lower density threshold, 500 ppsm.
This aids in identifying blocks that
do not meet the initial density
threshold, but may contain a mix
of residential and nonresidential
land use (parks, schools, commercial, retail, or industrial uses), and
therefore should 


Urban  = 50,000 population, 1,000 people per square


DoD
- Urban:  50,000 population,  3,000+ persons per square mile
- Suburban: 1,000 - 3,000 persons per square mile
- Rural: less than 1,000 persons per square mile

Income Buckets
0 - 45K low income
45k-140k mid income
140k+ high income

Region Type
- Urban:  50,000 population,  3,000+ persons per square mile
Suburban: 1,000 - 3,000 persons per square mile
Rural: less than 1,000 persons per square mile

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area
rural fewer than 2,500 residents; areas designated as rural can have population densities as high as 999 per square mile or as low as 1 person per square mile.[4]

Household Income Range	Millions of Households	% of Total	Comments
Less than $20,000	  19.7	  15%	Below or near poverty level
$20,000 - $44,999	  28.7	  23%	Low income
$45,000 - $139,999	  57.7	  45%	Middle class
$140,000 - $149,999	    2.6	    2%	Upper middle class
$150,000 - $199,999	    9.0	    7%	High income
$200,000+	    9.9	    8%	Highest tax brackets

0 - 45K low income
45k-140k mid income
140k+ high income




F.) what additional data to you need for additional categories?  
	* census def for :  
		- city type :
		- income levels : 

G.) what needs to be grouped ?

H.) what columns need to be reordered ?
		* SEE ORDER BELOW 

OK we need to merge in  census and numeric survey
