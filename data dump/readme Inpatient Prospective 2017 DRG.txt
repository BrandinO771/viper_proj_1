The Inpatient Utilization and Payment Public Use File (Inpatient PUF) provides information
 on inpatient discharges for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. The Inpatient PUF
 includes information on utilization, payment (total payment and Medicare payment),
 and hospital-specific charges for the more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare
 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments. The PUF is organized by hospital 
and Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) and covers Fiscal Year (FY) 2017. 
MS-DRGs included in the PUF represent more than 7 million discharges or 75 percent of total 
Medicare IPPS discharges.
